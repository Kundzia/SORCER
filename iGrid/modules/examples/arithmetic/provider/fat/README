In this examaple a plain SorcerProvider is used with an Arithmometer proxy. 
Compare it with SmartArithmometer and SemismartArithmometer cases.

The Arithmometer class is registered by a SorcerProvider as is 
(no exporter is used) and all proxy functionality is avalabe locally 
at the proxy requestor side. There is no any communication back to its 
registering service provider (SorcerProvider).

Note, that to deploy fat proxing it is sufficient to provide any object
as a proxy in the SorcerProvider configuration file only. 
No additional coding is required except for the proxy itself.
