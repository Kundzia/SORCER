Service-ORiented Computing EnviRonment - SORCER is a federated metacomputing system
that has been built at the SORCER lab at SORCERsoft.org - http://sorcersoft.org
It allows to create and provision service providers in heterogeneous service intergrid (iGrid) 
and execute service commands, called exertions, that in runtime create service 
federation in the iGrid that are managed by the SORCER operating system on its iGrid.
